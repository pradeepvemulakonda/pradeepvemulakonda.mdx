Introduction to C# and Java type systems. Links to details are provided for reference.

Both specifications defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the language runtime([VES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Execution_System), [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)) and is also an important part of the runtime's support for cross-language integration.

* Enables type safety and high performant code across platforms and languagues.
* Defines rules that the languague must follow, which ensures objects created in different languagues can intercat with each other.
  ([VB.Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET) can talk to C# libraries, [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy) can use Java libraries).
* Provides primitive types used in application development.

This topic contains the following sections:

* [Types](#headTypes)
* [Type definitions](#headDef)
