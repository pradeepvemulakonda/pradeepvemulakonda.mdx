# Band diagrams
Before we go to the details of band diagrams. Lets understand on a very basic level what energy bands
are and how they form.
[Quantum Mechanical Model](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/quantum-numbers-and-orbitals/a/the-quantum-mechanical-model-of-the-atom)

## Hydrogen Atom
Below is a representation of a hydrogen atom with the sub atomic radius of ~0.52 A(Amstrongs). 
The [Bohr radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) (a0 or rBohr) is a physical constant, approximately equal to the most probable distance between the nucleus and the electron in a hydrogen atom in its ground state. 
It is named after Niels Bohr, due to its role in the Bohr model of an atom.

A quantum mechanical system or particle that is bound—that is, confined spatially—can only take on certain discrete values of energy.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level)
[quantum number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_number)

Four quantum numbers can describe an electron in an atom completely. As per the following model, these nearly-compatible quantum numbers are:

- Principal quantum number (n)
- Azimuthal quantum number (ℓ)
- Magnetic quantum number (m)
- Spin quantum number (s)

## Potential well[(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_well)
A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. 
Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. 
Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to due to entropy.

### [Stationary State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state)
A stationary state is also called energy eigenvector, energy eigenstate, energy eigenfunction, or energy eigenket. 
It is very similar to the concept of atomic orbital and molecular orbital in chemistry

Comparison of classical and quantum harmonic oscillator conceptions for a single spinless particle. The two processes differ greatly. The classical process (A–B) is represented as the motion of a particle along a trajectory. 
The quantum process (C–H) has no such trajectory. Rather, it is represented as a wave; here, the vertical axis shows the real part (blue) and imaginary part (red) of the wave function. Panels (C–F) show four different standing-wave solutions of the Schrödinger equation. 
Panels (G–H) further show two different wave functions that are solutions of the Schrödinger equation but not standing waves.

The below diagram represents a [particle in a box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box)

In a the interatomic space is more than the wave/orbitals the energy levels are discrete.

When the atoms are tightly packed for eample in a semi conductor. 
The energy levels interact and energy gets split into multiple lebels each. There levels are batched together into energy bands.

In a 1D lattice the atom's energy elevls interact with each other resulting in band formation.
