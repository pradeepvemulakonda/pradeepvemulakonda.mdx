An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#)

What does a Java tutorial talk about atoms?
Before we talk about performance of computer code, memory, objects we should understand the basics of how computers work.

As part of this tutorial, I will lightly touch upon the basics of physics and chemistry including solid state physics. I will add multiple references to the content and if you feel that this is not for you, skip directly to [Intro](Java introduction).
