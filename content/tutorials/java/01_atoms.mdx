An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom#)

What does a Java tutorial talk about atoms?
Before we talk about performance of computer code, memory, objects we should understand the basics of how computers work.

As part of this tutorial, I will lightly touch upon the basics of physics and chemistry including solid state physics. I will add multiple references to the content and if you feel that this is not for you, skip directly to [Intro](Java introduction).

## Bohr Model
Although not accurate gives us a basic understanding of the hydrogen atom. An atom consits of a central 
nucleus consists of protons and neutrons and an outer shell consisting of electrons. 
The electrons can the orbitals and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of 
energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon

To be more precise, the orbitals are not perfect circles but pocesses the chanrecteristic of an electron cloud.
The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. 
This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. 
The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.
Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [particle and a wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality).
