## Fermi Level

"Fermi level" is the term used to describe the top of the collection of electron energy levels at absolute zero temperature. 
This concept comes from Fermi-Dirac statistics. Electrons are fermions and by the Pauli exclusion principle cannot exist in identical energy states. 
So at absolute zero they pack into the lowest available energy states and build up a "Fermi sea" of electron energy states.[1](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/Fermi.html)

#### Fermiâ€“Dirac distribution
The Fermi function f(E) gives the probability that a given available electron energy state will be occupied at a given temperature. 
The Fermi function comes from Fermi-Dirac statistics and has the form

$$
{\displaystyle F(\epsilon )={\frac {1}{e^{(\epsilon -\mu )/k_{\rm {B}}T}+1}}}
$$

The basic nature of this function dictates that at ordinary temperatures, most of the levels up to the Fermi level EF are filled, 
and relatively few electrons have energies above the Fermi level. 

The illustration below shows the implications of the Fermi function for the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor. 
The band theory of solids gives the picture that there is a sizable gap between the Fermi level and the conduction band of the semiconductor. At higher temperatures, 
a larger fraction of the electrons can bridge this gap and participate in electrical conduction.
