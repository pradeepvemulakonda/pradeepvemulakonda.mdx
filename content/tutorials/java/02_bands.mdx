## Band Theory of solids

The electrons of a single, isolated atom occupy atomic orbitals each of which has a discrete energy level. 
When two or more atoms join together to form into a molecule, their atomic orbitals overlap.
The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that no two electrons can have the same quantum numbers in a molecule. 
So if two identical atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule, each atomic orbital splits into two molecular orbitals of different energy, 
allowing the electrons in the former atomic orbitals to occupy the new orbital structure without any having the same energy.

This formation of bands is mostly a feature of the outermost electrons (valence electrons) in the atom, which are the ones involved in chemical bonding and electrical conductivity. 
The inner electron orbitals do not overlap to a significant degree, so their bands are very narrow.

## Bands in a metal and insulator

A solid has an infinite number of allowed bands, just as an atom has infinitely many energy levels. However, most of the bands simply have too high energy, and are usually disregarded under ordinary circumstances. Conversely, there are very low energy bands associated with the core orbitals (such as 1s electrons). 
These low-energy core bands are also usually disregarded since they remain filled with electrons at all times, and are therefore inert. Likewise, materials have several band gaps throughout their band structure.

The most important bands and band gaps—those relevant for electronics and optoelectronics—are those with energies near the Fermi level. 
The bands and band gaps near the Fermi level are given special names, depending on the material:

In a semiconductor or band insulator, the Fermi level is surrounded by a band gap, referred to as the band gap (to distinguish it from the other band gaps in the band structure). The closest band above the band gap is called the conduction band, and the closest band beneath the band gap is called the valence band. 
The name "valence band" was coined by analogy to chemistry, since in semiconductors (and insulators) the valence band is built out of the valence orbitals.
- In a metal or semimetal, the Fermi level is inside of one or more allowed bands. 
- In semimetals the bands are usually referred to as "conduction band" or "valence band" depending on whether the charge transport is more electron-like or hole-like, by analogy to semiconductors. 
- In many metals, however, the bands are neither electron-like nor hole-like, and often just called "valence band" as they are made of valence orbitals.

### Conduction Band
The conduction band is the band of electron orbitals that electrons can jump up into from the valence band when excited. When the electrons are in these orbitals, they have enough energy to move freely in the material. 
This movement of electrons creates an electric current.

### Valence Band
The valence band is simply the outermost electron orbital of an atom of any specific material that electrons actually occupy. 
This is closely related to the idea of the valence electron.

### Band gap
The energy difference between the highest occupied energy state of the valence band and the lowest unoccupied state of the conduction band is called the band gap 
and is indicative of the electrical conductivity of a material.

### Valence electron
Valence electrons are the electrons orbiting the nucleus in the outermost atomic shell of an atom.
Valence electrons also tend to be the electrons that specifically participate in a chemical bond, like ionic bonds or covalent bonds.

### Fermi level
The Fermi level is the name given to the highest energy occupied electron orbital at absolute zero.
