### Solid materials
Solid materials are classified by the way the atoms are arranged within the solid.([1](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_2.htm))

#### Amorphous
Materials in which atoms are placed at random are called amorphous. 

#### Crystals
Materials in which atoms are placed in a highly ordered structure are called crystalline.
Crystals are categorized by their crystal structure and the underlying lattice. 
While some crystals have a single atom placed at each lattice point, most crystals have a combination of atoms associated with each lattice point. 
This combination of atoms is also called the basis.

#### Crystalline [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor)
The classification of lattices, the common semiconductor crystal structures and the growth of single-crystal semiconductors are discussed in the following sections.([2](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_2.htm))

##### Bravais lattices
The Bravais lattices are the distinct lattice types, which when repeated can fill the whole space.
The three cubic Bravais lattices are the simple cubic lattice, the body-centered cubic lattice and the face-centered cubic lattice as shown
