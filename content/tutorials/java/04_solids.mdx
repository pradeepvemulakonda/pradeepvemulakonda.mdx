### Solid materials
Solid materials are classified by the way the atoms are arranged within the solid.([1](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/book/chapter2/ch2_2.htm))

#### Amorphous
Materials in which atoms are placed at random are called amorphous. 

#### Crystals
Materials in which atoms are placed in a highly ordered structure are called crystalline.

#### Crystalline [semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor)

The basic nature of this function dictates that at ordinary temperatures, most of the levels up to the Fermi level EF are filled, 
and relatively few electrons have energies above the Fermi level. 

The illustration below shows the implications of the Fermi function for the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor. 
The band theory of solids gives the picture that there is a sizable gap between the Fermi level and the conduction band of the semiconductor. At higher temperatures, 
a larger fraction of the electrons can bridge this gap and participate in electrical conduction.
